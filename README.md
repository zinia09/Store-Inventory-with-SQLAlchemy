# Store Inventory with SQLAlchemy
## techdegree-project-4

Store Inventory is a console based program built using Python and SQLite database. The app loads an existing store's inventory data from a CSV file into a SQLite database. The user can then interact with the database to view existing records, add new items, and backup the existing state of the database into a CSV file.
